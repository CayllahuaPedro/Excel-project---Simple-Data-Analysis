# Excel-project---Simple-Data-Analysis
I started this project as a way to revise the fundamentals of excel that I studied back in highschool. It consists of a dataset of bike buyers from which it can be extracted very useful insights. 

In this work I used things like:
* Pivot tables 
* Charts 
* Data filters
* find and replace tools
* sort data
* conditionals
